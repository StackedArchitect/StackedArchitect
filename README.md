## Hi there, I'm The StackedArchitect ðŸ‘‹

Driven by curiosity and a love for building things from the ground up, I'm a final-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering Student who has pursued a Minor degree in Computer Science with a keen interest in Computer architecture and Digital electronics. From simulating instruction pipelines to building Web applications **(Hardware -> Software)**, I enjoy diving deep into how things work â€” and how they can work better.

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between low-level systems and high-level intelligence. Whether itâ€™s designing with Verilog, optimizing algorithms, or experimenting with ML models, I thrive at the intersection of structure and creativity. When I'm involved in debugging/designing, you're also likely to find me exploring open-source projects, scribbling down ideas, or reading up on emerging tech.

My academic journey has been a hands-on mix of **Digital Electronics, Architecture Design**, **CS Fundamentals**, and **Intelligent Models using ML** â€” all of which shape how I approach problem-solving today. I believe in clean abstractions, purposeful design, and lifelong learning.
